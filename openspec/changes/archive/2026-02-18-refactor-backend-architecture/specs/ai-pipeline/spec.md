## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: LangGraph Pipeline Definition
The system SHALL define a LangGraph `StateGraph` for the goal understanding pipeline with nodes `classify`, `generate_questions`, and `generate_board`. The graph SHALL use a `GoalPipelineState` TypedDict as its state schema. The `GoalPipelineState` SHALL include a `board_generation` field (nullable `BoardGenerationOutput`) for storing the board generation result and a `memory_context` field (string, default empty) for holding the formatted memory block retrieved before pipeline execution. Individual nodes SHALL be defined in `app/domains/ai/nodes/`. All nodes SHALL use a shared LLM factory from `app/domains/ai/llm.py` instead of duplicating LLM instantiation logic. The AI service layer (`app/domains/ai/service.py`) SHALL expose simple async functions (`classify_goal`, `generate_questions`, `generate_follow_up_questions`, `generate_board`) that hide LangGraph internals from callers. The service layer SHALL retrieve relevant memories and pass the formatted memory context to pipeline nodes. Cross-domain types (`BoardSkeletonOutput`, `TaskEnrichmentOutput`) SHALL be imported from `app/core/types.py`.

#### Scenario: Pipeline executes classification then question generation
- **WHEN** the AI service's `classify_goal` function is called with raw goal text
- **THEN** the LangGraph pipeline executes the classify node followed by the generate_questions node (if not rejected) and returns the combined result

#### Scenario: Pipeline short-circuits on rejection
- **WHEN** the classify node produces a confidence score below the rejection threshold
- **THEN** the pipeline does not execute the generate_questions node and returns the rejection result

#### Scenario: Board generation invoked as separate entry point
- **WHEN** the AI service's `generate_board` function is called with a goal
- **THEN** only the generate_board node executes (not the full classify+questions pipeline)

#### Scenario: Memory context available in pipeline state
- **WHEN** the service layer invokes the pipeline for a user with stored memories
- **THEN** the `GoalPipelineState.memory_context` field contains the formatted memory block

#### Scenario: Shared LLM factory used across nodes
- **WHEN** any AI node needs to instantiate a ChatOpenAI client
- **THEN** it imports and calls `get_llm()` from `app/domains/ai/llm.py` instead of defining its own factory

### Requirement: Board Chat Graph
The system SHALL implement a LangGraph `StateGraph` for board-level AI chat, compiled with the PostgreSQL checkpointer. The graph SHALL share common utilities (should_continue, execute_tools, field extraction) with the task chat graph via `app/domains/ai/graphs/base.py`. The chat graph state SHALL include: `messages` (list of chat messages), `board_id` (string), `user_id` (string), `board_context` (string), `memory_context` (string), and `goal_context` (string). The graph SHALL implement the same ReAct agent loop pattern as the task chat graph. The LLM model SHALL be bound to the board chat tool set via `model.bind_tools(tools)` using tools from the tool registry's `get_board_chat_tools`. The system prompt SHALL instruct the AI about its board-level role. Each board's chat session SHALL use a thread ID of format `board-chat-{board_id}`. The graph SHALL be defined in `app/domains/ai/graphs/board_chat.py`. The graph SHALL enforce a maximum of 10 tool-call iterations per turn.

#### Scenario: First message in board chat
- **WHEN** a user sends the first chat message for board "b1" (thread "board-chat-b1")
- **THEN** the graph creates a new thread, injects board context and memory context, and produces an AI response

#### Scenario: Resuming board chat
- **WHEN** a user sends a second message to a board after a previous conversation
- **THEN** the graph loads the existing thread state from the checkpointer and continues the conversation

#### Scenario: AI uses board structure tool
- **WHEN** a user says "I think we should add a task for getting travel insurance" in board chat
- **THEN** the AI calls `add_task` with appropriate parameters and returns a pending_confirmation result

#### Scenario: AI analyzes board progress
- **WHEN** a user asks "What's my overall progress?" in board chat
- **THEN** the AI calls `get_board_progress`, receives stats, and provides a natural language summary

#### Scenario: AI suggests next actions
- **WHEN** a user asks "What should I work on next?" in board chat
- **THEN** the AI calls `get_blocked_tasks` and `list_all_tasks` to understand the board state, then recommends unlocked tasks based on priority and dependencies

#### Scenario: Shared graph utilities in base module
- **WHEN** the board chat graph needs should_continue or execute_tools logic
- **THEN** it imports these functions from `app/domains/ai/graphs/base.py` rather than reimplementing them
